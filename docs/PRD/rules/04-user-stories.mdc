# User Stories & Requirements Rules

## Purpose
Transform user research and MRD insights into actionable user stories and acceptance criteria.

## Prerequisites
- Completed user persona development
- Identified key problems and solutions from MRD

## User Story Generation Framework

### 1. Epic Definition
Group related functionality into epics:

```markdown
## Epic: [Epic Name]
**Goal**: [What this epic achieves]
**Personas**: [Which personas benefit]
**Success Metrics**: [How to measure completion]
```

### 2. User Story Format
Follow standard format with clear value proposition:

```markdown
## User Story: [Story ID]
**As a** [persona]
**I want to** [action/feature]
**So that** [benefit/value]

### Acceptance Criteria
Given [initial context]
When [action taken]
Then [expected outcome]

### Technical Notes
- [Any technical constraints]
- [Dependencies]
- [Performance requirements]

### Story Points
Estimation: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
Priority: [P0, P1, P2, P3]
```

### 3. Story Breakdown Guidelines

#### For each major feature from MRD:
1. Create 1 epic
2. Break into 3-7 user stories
3. Ensure each story is:
   - Independent
   - Negotiable
   - Valuable
   - Estimable
   - Small
   - Testable

### 4. Prioritization Matrix

```markdown
| Story ID | Business Value | Technical Effort | Risk | Priority |
|----------|---------------|------------------|------|----------|
| [ID]     | High/Med/Low  | 1-13 points     | H/M/L| P0-P3   |
```

## Story Generation Prompts

```
For [Feature Name]:
1. Who is the primary user?
2. What specific action do they need to take?
3. What value does this deliver?
4. What are the edge cases?
5. How do we know it's done?
```

## Output Format

```markdown
## User Stories

### Epic: [Epic Name]

#### Story [ID]: [Title]
**As a** [persona]
**I want to** [action]
**So that** [benefit]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given [context], When [action], Then [outcome]
2. Given [context], When [action], Then [outcome]

**Priority**: P[0-3]
**Estimation**: [points]

[Repeat for all stories]
